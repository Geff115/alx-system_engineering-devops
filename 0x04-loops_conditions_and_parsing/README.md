 Weight: 1

For this project:
	- I learnt how to create SSH keys.
	- I learnt the advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash.
	- All my files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
	- I am not allowed to use awk.
	- My Bash script must pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without any error.
	- The first line of all my Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash.
	- The second line of all my Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing.
