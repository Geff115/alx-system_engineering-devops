Scripting

For this project:
	- All my files are interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
	- All my Bash scripts are executable.
	- All my files end with a new line.
	- All my Bash script must pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0 via apt-get) without any error.
	- The first line of all my Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash.
	- The second line of all my Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script is doing.
